## 1. The birth of JavaScript

- 1994, The **_Netscape_** is in urgent need of a web scripting language that **_allows browsers to interact with the web_**.
- In 1995, the Sun company renamed the Oak language as **_Java_** and officially launched it to the market.
  Sun has hyped up and promised that this language can be written in a Write Once Run Anywhere. It looks likely to become the master of the future.
- The situation at the time was that the entire management of the **_Netscape_** was a believer in the Java language, and **_Sun_** was fully involved in the decision of the web scripting language.
