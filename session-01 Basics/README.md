# Session 01 Basics

## 1. The birth of JavaScript

- 1994, The **_Netscape_** is in urgent need of a web scripting language that **_allows browsers to interact with the web_**.
- In 1995, the Sun company renamed the Oak language as **_Java_** and officially launched it to the market.
  Sun has hyped up and promised that this language can be written in a Write Once Run Anywhere. It looks likely to become the master of the future.
- The situation at the time was that the entire management of the **_Netscape_** was a believer in the Java language, and **_Sun_** was fully involved in the decision of the web scripting language.

    <b>Brendan Eich</b>
</p>

In general, the idea of **Brendan Eich**'s design is this:

1. Draw on the basic grammar of the **_C language_**;
2. Learn from the data types and memory management of **_Java language_**;
3. Using the **_Scheme_** language as reference, the function is promoted to the status of "first class citizen";
4. Draw on the Self language and use the inheritance mechanism based on the prototype (prototype);

> " The influence of Java to JavaScript is to divide data into two basic types (**primitive**) and object types (**object**), such as **strings** and **string objects**, and introduce **_Y2K_** problem. It's really unfortunate. "
